# TO-DO List

## Overview

This To-Do List application is my First Beginner Level Task as part of the LetsGrowMore Virtual Internship Program (LGMVIP). The application is a demonstration of my understanding of the core concepts of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

It provides an efficient way to manage tasks. The application allows users to keep track of their work, with the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks. It offers a user-friendly and interactive environment with features such as click-to-edit, checkbox for completion, an alert for empty tasks, and a dynamic task counter.

## Features

1. **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.

2. **Edit Task:** Click-to-edit functionality allows users to easily modify existing tasks.

3. **Delete Task:** Users can remove tasks from their to-do list.

4. **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete. Completed tasks are crossed out, providing a clear visual representation of progress.

5. **Empty Task Alert:** The application alerts users if they try to add an empty task.

6. **Task Counter:** The application counts the number of tasks, updating this number dynamically as tasks are added or deleted.

7. **Auto-Save Feature:** The application auto-saves edits to tasks after a certain delay.
